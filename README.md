This plot illustrates the symmetric logistic function using normalized test data based on the confusion matrix:

Orange curve: Represents the symmetric logistic function derived from the test confusion matrix.
Blue points: Show the normalized predicted probabilities from the test dataset.
Dashed gray line: Indicates the decision threshold at 
ùë¶=0.5
y=0.5, where probabilities transition between 0 and 1.

# [Project 2: Market reviewr v.s rating] 
 a logistic regression model using Python, preprocess the data to create features from the text column (e.g., by vectorizing it) and use rating as the target variable for prediction and assurrance
I was able to get the model to predict the rating of review  with 75% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a market trained on market agency. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
